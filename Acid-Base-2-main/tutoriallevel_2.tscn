[center][font_size=24] [color=red]Recognizing Bases[/color] [/font_size][/center]

[font_size=18](a) Bases are often identified by the presence of an anion that can accept protons (H⁺ ions). Ionic compounds contain a positively-charged ion (cation) and a negatively-charged ion (anion). The anion in the compound can accept H⁺ ions, making it a base.
For example, Na₂CO₃ contains the carbonate ion (CO₃²⁻), which can accept two H⁺ ions, making it a base.[/font_size]

[font_size=18](b) However, there are exceptions to this. Some anions are part of strong acids and do not accept protons. These include Cl⁻, Br⁻, I⁻, NO₃⁻, ClO₄⁻, and HSO₄⁻.
For example, NaCl is not a base because the Cl⁻ ion is too weak to accept an H⁺ ion. This is because HCl is a strong acid, and Cl⁻ cannot hold onto an H⁺ ion.[/font_size]

[font_size=18](c) Another way to identify bases is by recognizing molecules that contain a nitrogen atom. Molecules with nitrogen often have a lone pair of electrons that can accept an H⁺ ion, making them bases. 
For example, NH₃ (ammonia) is a base. The nitrogen atom has a lone pair of electrons that can bond with an H⁺ ion.[/font_size]

[font_size=14]Note: If a molecule containing a nitrogen atom already has a positive charge, it has already acted as a base and accepted an H⁺ ion. In this case, the molecule is in its acidic form.
For example, NH₃ can accept an H⁺ ion to form NH₄⁺. NH₄⁺ is an acid because it can give the H⁺ ion back to a base.[/font_size]
